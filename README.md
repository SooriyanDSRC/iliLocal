# ILI Manager

Web Application.

### Tech

ILI Manager works with below technologies :

- [React Hook] - Hooks are the new feature introduced in the React 16.8 version. It allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks are the functions which "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. It does not work inside classes.

- [Redux] - Redux is used mostly for application state management. To summarize it, Redux maintains the state of an entire application in a single immutable state tree (object), which canâ€™t be changed directly.

- [material ui] - React components for faster and easier web development. Build your own design system, or start with Material Design.
